# My Mac Setup - Read the Game Settings first!

## Overview
- **Device:** M1 MacBook Air
- **Specs:** Base Model, 7 Core GPU

  ## Notes
- I either use cracked games because they don't run properly with their launcher OR I don't like the game enough to buy it
- You can request games to be tested by messaging me on Reddit (u/WhySooooFurious)

## Game Settings

### Simple Planes
- **Stability:** Very Stable

- **Settings:** Maxed
- **Method:** Rosetta (x64), Mac App Store

- **Settings:** Maxed
- **Method:** Native (ARM64), Steam
- **Notes:** Perfectly optimized. Stable at 30fps with maxed settings, high res and upscaling, 60fps+ on medium settings. This is how a good game should be! My theory is that it is designed for a iPhone and then ported over to mac with higher graphic settings

### Minecraft: Java Edition

- **FPS:** Excellent
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method:** Crossover (DXVK & D3DMetal), Steam & Native (x64)
- **Notes:** Looks ok with low settings. Reaches 60 fps and sometimes dips with occasional small stutters. Crossover works better than native because of native using outdated OpenGl. Mid res

### No Man's Sky
- **Stability:** Stable
- **FPS:** Ok
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method:** Native (ARM64), Steam
- **Notes:** Ok. I would expect more from a native game like this. High res and make sure to Enable FSR or MetalFX for higher fps. Doesn't look magnificent. Can reach 60fps with tweaking settings until thermal throttling comes over for dinner

### Dying Light 1
- **Stability:** Relatively Stable
- **FPS:** Good
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method:** Crossover (D3DMetal), Cracked
- **Notes:** FPS sometimes goes down to around 55-ish but gameplay is good. Not many stutters. Only Launches with D3DMetal option checked. Mid res

### Grand Theft Auto V
- **Stability:** Very Stable
- **FPS:** Excellent
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method:** Crossover (DXVK & D3DMetal), Cracked & Epic Games
- **Notes:** FPS can shoot up to 120 in some areas while it can go down to 60-80 in city areas. The high res has small stutters which is still playable at around 45fps in city areas. The lite version of GTA-V has a very big impact on stutter which is negligble now and helps boost the fps by a considerable amount. By upping some settings you can still gain 60fps with some drops
