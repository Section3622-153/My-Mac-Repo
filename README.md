What is it?
-

I got normal GTA-V, modded it and installed GTA-V Resized from https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-v-re-sized. Also removed DLCS and Radio Audio files

Cons:
-Radio will not work
-Weapon wheel sometimes glitches out
-Some missions don't work: Testing is needed lol
-Prologue's audio will not work
-Online will not work

Pros:
-Only 45gb. 
-Faster Loading
-Enormous FPS Boost because of the DLC's removed and GTA-V resized installed

Need to know info:
