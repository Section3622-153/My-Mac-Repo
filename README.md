# My Mac Setup - Read the Game Settings first!

## Overview
- **Device:** M1 MacBook Air
- **Specs:** Base Model, 7 Core GPU

- You can request games to be tested by messaging me on Reddit (u/WhySooooFurious)

## Game Settings
- **V-Sync:** On
- **Resolution:** Specified
- **Graphics Settings:** As low as they can be or depending on the game and fps I can test with better settings
- **FPS:** Bad: 0-20, Good: 30-40, Excellent: 50-60, 
- **Stability:** Not Stable: Stuttery mess, Relatively Stable: Some stutters, Very Stable: Buttery smooth

- **Resolution:** 2560x1600
- **Settings:** Maxed
- **Method:** Rosetta (x64), Mac App Store
- **Notes:** Perfect FPS with high res. Depends on the plane you choose and the amount of 'parts' it has

### Resident Evil: Village
- **Stability:** Very Stable
- **FPS:** Good
- **Resolution:** 2560x1600 and MetalFX
- **Settings:** Maxed
- **Method:** Native (ARM64), Steam
- **Notes:** Perfectly optimized. Stable at 30fps with maxed settings, 60fps+ on medium settings. This is how a good game should be! My theory is that it is designed for an iPhone and then ported over to Mac with higher graphic settings

### Minecraft: Java Edition
- **Stability:** Very Stable
- **FPS:** Excellent
- **Resolution:** 2560x1600
- **Settings:** Maxed
- **Method:** Native (ARM64), Prism Launcher

- **FPS:** Excellent
- **Resolution:** 1680x1050
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method:** Crossover (DXVK & D3DMetal), Steam & Native (x64)
- **Notes:** Looks ok with low settings. Reaches 60 fps and sometimes dips with occasional small stutters. Crossover works better than native because of native using outdated OpenGl translation layer.

### No Man's Sky
- **Stability:** Stable
- **FPS:** Ok
- **Resolution:** 2560x1600 with MetalFX
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method:** Native (ARM64), Steam
- **Notes:** Ok. I would expect more from a native game like this. High res and make sure to Enable FSR or MetalFX for higher fps. Doesn't look magnificent. Can reach 60fps with tweaking settings until thermal throttling comes over for dinner

### Dying Light 1
- **Stability:** Relatively Stable
- **FPS:** Good
- **Resolution:** 1680x1050
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method:** Crossover (D3DMetal), Cracked
- **Notes:** FPS sometimes goes down to around 55-ish but gameplay is good. Not many stutters. For me it only Launches with D3DMetal option checked.

### Grand Theft Auto V
- **Stability:** Very Stable
- **FPS:** Excellent
- **Resolution:** 
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method:** Crossover (DXVK & D3DMetal), Cracked & Epic Games
- **Notes:** FPS can shoot up to 120 in some areas while it can go down to 60-80 in city areas. You can install GTA-V Resized using OpenIV and get rid of stutters and gain more stability, keep in mind you can't go online if you do this. Online is ok since M-Sync was added which was a life saver. Online is around 40-50 fps which can go down depending where you're at. When you're near other players fps drops as well.
