### Resident Evil: Village - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Very Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Good
- **Resolution:** 2560x1600 and MetalFX
- **Settings:** Maxed
- **Method & Source:** Native (ARM64), Steam
- **Notes:** Perfectly optimized. Stable at 30fps with maxed settings, 60fps+ on medium settings. This is how a good game should be! My theory is that it is designed for an iPhone and then ported over to Mac with higher graphic settings.

### Minecraft: Java Edition - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Very Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Perfect
- **Resolution:** 2560x1600
- **Settings:** Maxed

### Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Relatively Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Perfect
- **Resolution:** 1680x1050
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Crossover 23.6 (x64), Steam
- **Notes:** Looks ok with low settings. Reaches 60 fps and sometimes dips with occasional small stutters. Crossover works better than native because of native using outdated OpenGL translation layer.

### No Man's Sky - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Ok
- **Resolution:** 2560x1600 with FSR or MetalFX
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Native (ARM64), Steam
- **Notes:** Ok. I would expect more from a native game like this. High res and make sure to Enable FSR or MetalFX for higher fps. Doesn't look magnificent. Can reach 60fps with tweaking settings until thermal throttling comes over for dinner.

### Dying Light - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Relatively Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Perfect
- **Resolution:** 1680x1050
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Crossover 23.6 (x64), Cracked
- **Notes:** Sometimes the frame rate gets stuck at 53 for no reason. Gameplay is good. Not many stutters. For me, it only launches with D3DMetal option checked.

### Grand Theft Auto V - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Very Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Perfect
- **Resolution:** 
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Crossover 23.6 (x64), Cracked & Epic Games
- **Notes:** FPS can shoot up to 120 in some areas while it can go down to 60-80 in city areas. You can install GTA-V Resized using OpenIV and get rid of stutters and gain more stability, keep in mind you can't go online if you do this. Online is ok since M-Sync was added, which was a lifesaver. Online is around 40-50 fps, which can go down depending on where you're at. When you're near other players, fps drops as well. With D3DMetal, V-Sync doesn't work whether turned on or off in-game settings. Cracked works a bit better, in my opinion. Crossover 23.7 breaks the game.
