Testing
-
I've tested many games for MacOS using various methods

Dying Light 1:

│Relatively Stable│FPS:Good│Settings:Low│Crossover: D3DMetal│Cracked│

Notes:
FPS sometimes goes down to around 53-ish but gameplay is good. Not many stutters. Only Launches with D3DMetal option checked.

Grand Theft Auto V:

│Very Stable│FPS:Very Good│Settings:Low│Resolution:1680x1050│Crossover:DXVK & D3DMetal│Cracked│

Notes: FPS can shoot up to 120 in some areas while it can go down to 80-90 in city areas. The higher 2560x1600 resolution has small stutters which is still playable at around 45fps. The lite version of GTA-V has a very big impact on stutter which is negligble now and helps boost the fps by a considerable amount.

GTA-V + Resized + Lite

What is it?
-

I got normal GTA-V, modded it and installed GTA-V Resized from https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-v-re-sized. Also removed DLCS and Radio Audio files

Cons:
-Radio will not work
-Weapon wheel sometimes glitches out
-Some missions don't work: Testing is needed lol
-Prologue's audio will not work
-Online will not work

Pros:
-Only 45gb. 
-Faster Loading
-Enormous FPS Boost because of the DLC's removed and GTA-V resized installed

Installation
-
1. Download the "GTA V.zip"
2. Unpack the .zip file
3. Put the contents into your bottle or anywhere you would like
4. Go into Crossover
