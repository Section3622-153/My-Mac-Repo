Testing
-
I've tested many games for MacOS using various methods

Call of Duty (Any game):

│Not Stable│FPS:Bad│Settings:Maxed│Crossover:DXVK & D3DMetal│Mac App Store│  


Notes: Very bad. Don't even try it. Would work better in parallels but I haven't tried lmao.

Simple Planes:

│Very Stable│FPS:Excellent│Settings:Maxed│Rosetta: x64│Mac App Store│

Notes: Perfect FPS. Depends on the plane as well


Resident Evil: Village:

│Stable│FPS:Good│Settings:Maxed│Native: ARM64│Steam│

Notes:
Perfectly optimised. Perfect example of a good game made by good devs. Maxed out settings at 30fps stable. Low settings 60fps+

Minecraft: Java Edition:

│Very Stable│FPS:Excellent│Settings:Maxed│Native:ARM64│Prism Launcher│

Notes:
Perfect fps with Fabulously Optimised modpack. Nothing more to say.

Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition:

│Relatively Stable│FPS:Ok│Settings:Low│Crossover: DXVK & D3DMetal│Steam│

Notes:
Looks ok with low settings. Reaches 60 fps and sometimes dips with occasional small stutters.

No Man's Sky:

│Stable│FPS:Ok│Settings:Low│Native: ARM64│Steam│

Notes:
Ok. I would expect more from a native game like this. Enable FSR or MetalFX for higher fps. Doesn't look magnificent. Can reach 60fps with tweaking settings until thermal throttling kicks in.

Dying Light 1:

│Relatively Stable│FPS:Good│Settings:Low│Crossover: D3DMetal│Cracked│

Notes:
FPS sometimes goes down to around 53-ish but gameplay is good. Not many stutters. Only Launches with D3DMetal option checked.

Grand Theft Auto V:

│Very Stable│FPS:Excellent│Settings:Low│Crossover:DXVK & D3DMetal│Cracked│

Notes: FPS can shoot up to 120 in some areas while it can go down to 80-90 in city areas. The higher 2560x1600 resolution has small stutters which is still playable at around 45fps. The lite version of GTA-V has a very big impact on stutter which is negligble now and helps boost the fps by a considerable amount.

GTA-V + Resized + Lite

What is it?
-

I got normal GTA-V, modded it and installed GTA-V Resized from https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-v-re-sized. Also removed DLCS and Radio Audio files

Cons:
-Radio will not work
-Weapon wheel sometimes glitches out
-Some missions don't work: Testing is needed lol
-Prologue's audio will not work
-Online will not work

Pros:
-Only 45gb. 
-Faster Loading
-Enormous FPS Boost because of the DLC's removed and GTA-V resized installed

Installation
-
1. Download the "GTA V.zip"
2. Unpack the .zip file
3. Put the contents into your bottle or anywhere you would like
4. Go into Crossover
5. Click on your bottle
6. Select "Wine Configuration"
7. Select "Libraries"
8. Input "dinput8.dll" in the "New override for library"
9. Then click on add

   This will make sure it loads Scripthook for the OpenAsi plugin so a corrupt error message doesn't come up and it loads properly.
   Don't trust me? Put your finger up your ass.
