GTA-V + Resized + Lite

What is it?

I got normal GTA-V, modded it and installed GTA-V Resized from https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-v-re-sized

Cons:
-Radio
-Weapon wheel sometimes glitches out
-Some missions don't work: Testing is needed lol

Pros:
-Only 45gb. 
-Enormous FPS Boost because of the DLC's removed and GTA-V resized installed.

Need to know info:
