## Notes
- We either use cracked games because they don't run properly with their launcher OR We don't like the game enough to buy it OR We don't have enough money to buy it
- Cracked games have the same performance than non cracked games (some have drm protection like Denuvo which worsens the performance, cracked games hence perfrom better in these cases)
- You can request games to be tested by messaging the contributors on reddit or by creating a pull request
- You can help by telling me how a game runs using the format below and messaging the contributors on reddit or by creating a pull request and using the format below
- Whisky is basically the same as Crossover but free and better and it is what We prefer because it doesn't break everything every update!
- We will still put Crossover as what is being used to avoid confusion for the most part, Whisky and Crossover are basically the same

## Important Notes
- **Thermal Throttling:**
  - It will happen on some Macs, such as mine. Keep that in mind; these are mostly all burst tests, so expect some drop in frame rates over a longer period of time
- **Different Macs:** 
  - Contributors have different macs so make sure you've looked at their specs. The person who has tested the game will have their reddit username next to the title of the game
  - Contributors will try to use the settings listed below unless otherwise specified

## FAQ/Q&A

**My Macbook is getting hot/warm to the touch?**
- Don't worry at all, nothing will happen. When in use or under a bit of stress electronics tend to get hot. Macbooks will automatically throttle/reduce performance in order to meet correct temperatures or shut dowm themselves if the temperature it too high

**What does having an Apple Silicon/M-Series chip mean?**
- This is an apple designed chip based on the ARM64 architecture, commonly used in phones and low level gadgets, it is *very* power efficient and can be powerful as well while being compared to some Intel chips There are advantages and sadly some disadvantages, listed below

**Pros:**
  - Power Efficient which will result in more battery life
  - Perfomance compared to Intel equivalents in the Macbook line are very great
  - Quieter devices 
  - Better integrated graphics performance and support
  - Ability to run iPhone/iPad apps on your mac natively through apps like PlayCover
  - Through the use of Rosetta 2 x64 apps are still supported, quite well I might add
  - Unified Architecture

**Cons:**
  - No support for Windows or Bootcamp unless using software such as UTM and Parallels which will also have to be ARM64
  - Needing apps such as Crossover and Parallels to game apps that are not supported on macOS
  - No EGPU support
  - Only one external display
  - Bad/Obsolete x32 application support, this will likely not improve in the future
  - Needing Rosetta 2 in order to run x64 apps which will have performance loss
  - Applications might need updating, especially system extensions which will need to get updated from x64 to ARM64
  - Cannot emulate Android

**What does having an Intel chip mean?**
- You will most likely have one with an integrated GPU which will result in very poor gaming ability
- Intel Macs with a GPU can be good to game on
- Unlike Apple Silicon macs you will have access to the cons listed above

**What is Bootcamp?**
- Bootcamp is an application created by Apple that allows Intel Macs to get Windows, This can help Intel Mac users in order to get Windows-Only applications or simply just having Windows on your Mac

**Should I buy a Mac for gaming?**
- If you're going to buy a Mac just for gaming you will get laughed at
- If you're looking to buy a good reputable laptop with great build quality for school/work with the added benefit of gaming well for a laptop, yes you should

**I bought an Apple Silicon Mac for gaming, How do I game on it?**
 - First of all, there are 4 main ways in order to game

**Crossover/Whisky:** 
  - Apps that both utilise WINE which translates Windows API calls to MacOS API calls allowing the game to run through Rosetta 2, the translation layer from x64 to ARM64
  - This is a great option for gaming although x32 games will run horribly
  - Some games may not even launch if they might require other resources that WINE cannot provide

**Parallels:**
  - Virtualisation which involves running the Windows 10/11 ARM64 version on your mac
  - This method has way more compatability than Crossover and can also run x32 with higher performance
  - Also great for Windows Store applications, Windows apps in general and running applications that don't work with WINE apps

**Emulators**
  - This is a great option for playing old games up to PS3 or even PS4 in some cases but it might not work well with newer consoles and titles
  - I personally use RetroArch for older games such as (a good alternative is OpenEMU although RetroArch is easier on the eyes):
    - Amstrad - Amstrad CPC
    - Atari - 2600
    - Atari - 5200
    - Atari - 7800
    - Bandai - WonderSwan Color
    - Coleco - ColecoVision
    - Hudson Soft - PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16
    - Nintendo - Gameboy
    - Nintendo - Gameboy Color
    - Nintendo - Gameboy Advance
    - Nintendo - Nintendo DS
    - Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System
    - Nintendo - Super Nintendo Entertainment System
    - Sega - Game Gear
    - Sega - Master System - Mark III
    - Sega - Mega Drive - Genesis
    - Sega - SG1000
    - SNK - Neo Geo Pocket Color
    - Sord - Sord M5
  - For PS3 emulation you can use RPCS3
  - For Nintendo 3DS emulation you can use Citra

**Native Games**
  - This is the easiest and least time consuming
  - This method involves just finding games that either support x64 or ARM64 through vendors such as Playcover, Mac App Store, Steam or Epic Games
  - Keep in mind that Windows games will not install at all
  - These are just games made for macOS and macOS only!

- **Resolution:** 1680x1050 with FSR
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Native (x64), Steam
- **Notes:**
  - FPS sits at around 80-ish
  - FSR works well and increases fps by around 20 (included in above fps)
  - Pretty stuttery without V-Sync even though the game is at like 80, with and without FSR
  - V-Sync makes it buttery smooth

- **Resolution:** 2560x1600 and MetalFX

  - FPS depends on settings a lot
  - Perfectly optimized
  - Stable at 30fps with maxed settings and MetalFX
  - 60fps+ on medium settings and MetalFX

### Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Excellent
- **Resolution:** 1680x1050
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Crossover 23.6 (x64), Steam
- **Notes:**
  - Looks ok with low settings
  - Reaches 60 fps and sometimes dips with occasional small stutters
  - Crossover works better than native because of native using an outdated OpenGL translation layer

### No Man's Sky - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Perfect
- **Resolution:** 2560x1600 with FSR
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Native (ARM64), Steam
- **Notes:**
  - Ok.
  - I would expect more from a native game like this
  - High res and make sure to Enable FSR or MetalFX for higher fps
  - Doesn't look magnificent
  - Can reach 60fps with tweaking settings until thermal throttling comes over for dinner

### Dying Light - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Excellent
- **Resolution:** 1680x1050
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Crossover 23.6 (x64), Cracked
- **Notes:**
  - Sometimes the frame rate gets stuck at 53 for no reason
  - Gameplay is good
  - Not many stutters
  - For me, it only launches with D3DMetal option checked

### Grand Theft Auto V - u/WhySooooFurious
- **Stability:** Very Stable
- **Frame Rate:** Excellent
- **Resolution:** 1680x1050
- **Settings:** Low
- **Method & Source:** Crossover 23.6 (x64), Cracked & Epic Games
- **Notes:**
  - FPS can shoot up to 90 in some areas while it can go down to 50-70 in city areas
  - You can install GTA-V Resized using OpenIV and get rid of stutters and gain more stability (keep in mind you can't go online if you do this)
  - Online is ok since M-Sync was added
  - Online is around 40-50 fps, which can go down depending on where you're at
  - When you're near other players, fps drops as well
  - With D3DMetal, V-Sync doesn't work whether turned on or off in-game settings, broken
  - Cracked works a bit better, in terms of usability, No need to use Heroic if using the Epic Games Store for example
  - Crossover 23.7 breaks the game
  - 2560X1600 works at around 45fps
